A rather simple python keystroke logger client/server. 

The client is meant for win32 since it relies on pyhook which seems to be only win32.
Client sends keystrokes over UDP port 6666 by default to any IP address specified via
the command line: keylogClient -s <ip> -p <port>

The server receives the keys via udp and prints to screen, translating carrage returns, etc to chr(X); i.e. cr=chr(13)
